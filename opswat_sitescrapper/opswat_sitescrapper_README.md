# OPSWAT SiteScrapper

## Overview

**OPSWAT SiteScrapper** is a Python-based tool designed to scrape and extract information from websites for use within the OPSWAT ecosystem. This module is part of the `chatbot-sdk-implementations` repository and is intended to provide structured website data for downstream processing, such as chatbot knowledge ingestion, analytics, or automated workflows.

Typical use cases include:
- Extracting text content, metadata, or structured data from specified URLs
- Crawling a set of web pages under a domain to collect relevant information
- Preparing website data for machine learning or knowledge base applications

The scrapper can be configured for single or multiple sites and is suitable for integration in automated data pipelines.

## Features

- **URL-based scraping:** Scrape content from one or multiple URLs.
- **Customizable extraction:** Easily adapt what content is extracted (text, metadata, etc.).
- **Extensible:** Integrate with other OPSWAT tools or chatbots.
- **Automated workflows:** Suitable for scheduled or triggered site data collection.

## Usage

### 1. Basic Usage

You can run the SiteScrapper as a standalone Python script or import it as a module in your code.

**Example: Run as script**

```bash
python opswat_sitescrapper/scrapper.py --url "https://example.com"
```

**Example: Import as module**

```python
from opswat_sitescrapper.scrapper import SiteScrapper

scrapper = SiteScrapper()
data = scrapper.scrape("https://example.com")
print(data)
```

### 2. Options

- `--url` : The URL to scrape (required for CLI usage)
- `--output` : Output file to save results (optional)
- Additional arguments may be available; check the script's help:

```bash
python opswat_sitescrapper/scrapper.py --help
```

---

## Customization

- To change what information is scraped (e.g., adding metadata, filtering tags), edit the main scraping logic in `scrapper.py`.
- Integrate with other OPSWAT or chatbot SDK modules for downstream processing.

---

## Example Output

The output is typically a dictionary or JSON with the extracted data, for example:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "title": "Example Domain",
  "text": "This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents.",
  "meta": {
    "description": "Example Domain"
  }
}
```
